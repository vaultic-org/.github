# 🏢 Vaultic — Secure Storage & Encrypted Collaboration

**Vaultic** is a privacy-first platform for encrypted backup, file sharing, and data collaboration.  
It is built on a zero-knowledge architecture where your content is encrypted end-to-end — before leaving your device.

This organization hosts Vaultic’s official tools, libraries, and integrations for developers and users.

## 🛡 Philosophy

- 🔐 **End-to-end encryption**: Your data is encrypted before it touches any server.
- 🧱 **Modular architecture**: CLI, SDK, and Web all interact through a shared API.
- 🧠 **Zero trust**: Vaultic stores encrypted content, but never sees your keys or data.
- 🤝 **Developer-first**: Designed to be integrated into your apps, tools, and workflows.
- 💼 **Compliant-ready**: Architected to support use in regulated environments (health, legal, education).

## 🚧 Status

Vaultic is under **active development**.  
Public releases of the CLI and SDK are underway. The SaaS platform is coming soon.

If you're a developer, privacy enthusiast, or E2EE advocate — you're welcome to follow, test, or contribute.
