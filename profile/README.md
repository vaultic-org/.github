# 🏢 Vaultic — End-to-End Encryption Platform

**Vaultic** is a modular, privacy-first platform for encrypted backup, secure collaboration, and zero-knowledge encryption services.  
We provide tools for both end users and developers to encrypt, store, and manage data — without ever exposing secrets.

This organization hosts all official Vaultic components: CLI, SDKs, cryptographic engine, and developer integrations.

## 🛡 Philosophy

- 🔐 **End-to-end encryption**: Data is encrypted on your device — we never see it.
- 🧱 **Composable architecture**: Combine CLI, SDK, and API based on your needs.
- ⚙️ **Crypto transparency**: Core engine is open, auditable, and written in Rust.
- 🧠 **Zero trust by default**: No secret keys stored. No server-side decryption.
- 🧑‍💻 **Built for developers**: Easy to embed encryption in any SaaS, tool, or workflow.

---

## 📦 Use Cases

- Secure incremental backup (via Vaultic CLI)
- Privacy-preserving file storage (BYOS)
- Embedded encryption in apps and services
- SaaS integrations designed with **GDPR and HIPAA principles in mind**

---

## 🚧 Status

Vaultic is in **active development**.  
The CLI and SDK are usable today. A full SaaS offering is coming soon, with usage-based billing, encrypted identity management, and complete EU-grade data compliance.

If you’re a developer, privacy advocate, or working in a regulated industry — this platform is for you.
